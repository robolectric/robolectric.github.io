# Release Notes

-----
## [Release 2.3](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/robolectric/robolectric/2.3) - May 20, 2014
-----

#### Features

- Robolectric will now load (at runtime) the Android SDK that matches either the value of `targetSdkVersion` or the value specified in a `@Config` annotation.
- Robolectric now uses a real implementation of SQLite instead of a collection of shadows and fakes. Tests can now be written to verify real database behavior.
- Robolectric will now parse content provider declarations from your manifest and return them via the `ContentResolver` mechanism. In addition, `CursorLoaders` and `AsyncTaskLoaders` are now correctly tied into Robolectric's scheduler mechanism.
- New `ServiceController` component (similar to `ActivityController`) which can be used to safely drive a service through its lifecycle.
- Meta-data values, permissions, and intent filters are now parsed out of the manifest and available from `ShadowApplication`.
- Removal of a bunch of unnecessary shadows.

#### Bug Fixes

- Lots of resource and manifest parsing fixes.
- Lots of miscellaneous improvements to shadows.

#### Upgrade Notes

- The reflective lifecycle methods on `ShadowActivity` (`callOnCreate`, `callOnResume`, etc) have been removed. You are now required to use an `ActivityController` to drive an `Activity` through its lifecycle.

-----
## [Release 2.2](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/robolectric/robolectric/2.2) - October 7, 2013
-----

#### Features
- Robolectric now does not have a fake implementation of `Window` (`RoboWindow`). It has been removed and we now use the internal `PhoneWindow` class. This allows the `getActionBar()` method in Activity to return a real `ActionBar` implementation in tests.
- To create and manage Activity instances, you must now use the ActivityController interface (see `Robolectric.buildActivity()`)
- Added `visible()` method to `ActivityController`. `visible()` must be called on an activity in order for `View.isShown()` to report back anything but false, since it hooks up the `Activity`'s view hierarchy to the `WindowManager`.
- Some shadows were removed (`ShadowListActivity`)

#### Bug Fixes
- `Animation.hasEnded()` works as expected
- `AsyncTask`s no longer swallow exceptions that are thrown during `onPostExecute()`
- `Context.startActivity()` calls can now optionally check if the specified `Activity` is in the `PackageManager` using `Robolectric.checkActivities(true)`
- Many many issues fixed
- Better support for Windows development environments
- Documentation updates!

-----
## [Release 2.1.1](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/robolectric/robolectric/2.1.1/) - June 4, 2013
-----

#### Bug Fixes
- Qualifiers given in a `@Config` annotation on test classes weren't honored; fixed.

-----
## [Release 2.1](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/robolectric/robolectric/2.1/) - May 29, 2013
-----

#### Features
- Layout inflation is now handled by real Android OS code.
- Improved support for "style" attribute and theme queries in layout attributes.
- Implemented AssetManager.openXmlResourceParser().
- Support for using disk-based SQLite databases.

#### Bug Fixes
- ActionBarSherlock should work, pretty much.
- Fixed bugs in Handler.sendMessageAtTime(), and various timing issues.
- Numerous other fixes and improvements from the Robolectric community! Thank you contributors!

#### Known Issues
- Animations aren't well-supported.

-----
## [Release 2.0-alpha-3](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/robolectric/robolectric/2.0-alpha-3/) - May 8, 2013
-----

_Note:_
This is an unstable alpha release: expect bugs and upcoming changes to the API.

See [this blog post](http://robolectric.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-test-lifecycle-in-20.html) for notes about changes to how tests are run.

#### Features
- Massive realism upgrade: we removed many, many shadows, particularly for views and widgets, so they'll behave much more realistically.
- Dramatically improved resource loading, with support for themes and styles.
- Easier TestRunner setup and configuration.
- The new <code>@Config</code> annotation to specify config for a test class or test method:
- The SDK level to report: <code>@Config(reportSdk=Build.VERSION_CODES.FROYO)</code>
- Qualifiers for resource loading: <code>@Config(qualifiers="fr-port-hdpi")</code>
- Custom shadow classes to enable.
- For classes and methods that aren't explicitly shadowed, Robolectric now calls through to the real SDK code.
- Views now complain if you try to pass in a null Context. Don't do it!
- SDK method execution is now much much faster, especially in cases where we use the actual SDK code rather than a shadow (which will increasingly be the normal case).
- Performance and memory use improvements.
- Removed Hamcrest matchers; use [fest-android](https://github.com/square/fest-android) instead.
- Numerous fixes and improvements from the Robolectric community. Thank you, contributors!

  <code>MapController</code>s, and <code>ItemizedOverlay</code>s.


-----
### [Release 0.9.5](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/pivotallabs/robolectric/0.9.5/) - December 23, 2010
-----

#### Note
We have recently changed the Robolectric project structure to work with Maven. If you are developing directly from the
repository rather than from a jar release then you should close your IDE, delete its project files (.classpath,
&#42;.iml, etc...) and reload the project by importing the pom.xml into your IDE. This process has been tested with
both IntelliJ and Eclipse.

#### Features
- Improved testing of asynchronous and background tasks. <code>Looper</code>s and <code>AsyncTask</code> background
  threads are now un-paused by default (see <code>Robolectric.pauseMainLooper()</code> et al.).
- Shadows for <code>Bitmap</code>, <code>BitmapFactory</code>, and <code>Canvas</code>, and related classes, with
  textual descriptions (see <code>Robolectric.visualize()</code>) - Thanks xtremelabs!
- Improved HTTP testing (see <code>Robolectric.addHttpResponseRule()</code>).
- Shadow for <code>Camera</code>, <code>Camera.Parameters</code>, <code>MediaRecorder</code> - Thanks mportuesi!
- Shadow for <code>ArrayAdapter</code> - Thanks mylacc!
- Shadow for <code>ExpandableListView</code> - Thanks casidiablo!
- Nicer stack traces from within shadowed methods.
- Now available from Maven Central (and built with Maven).
- More shadowed methods on numerous classes.
- The <code>onCreate()</code> method of the application is no longer called automatically as part of test setup and
  must now be called manually.


-----

-----
### Release 0.9.3 - December 3, 2010
-----

#### Features
- Shadow for <code>AsyncTask</code>
- Integrated contributions for <code>ShadowConnectivityManager</code> and <code>ShadowNetworkInfo</code> - Thanks
  macarse!
- A HUGE contribution from the team at [Zoodles](http://www.zoodles.com), the in test SQLite database
  (<code>ShadowSQLiteDababase</code>) is backed by h2, reducing the need for database mocking. Thank You Zoodles!
- Robolectric now instantiates applications that are of the type specified in the AndroidManifest.xml - Thanks
  Mike Burton!
- The Robolectric jars will now work for projects that use the standard Android SDK (and not the Android Google APIs
  version which contains optional APIs such as Google Maps).

#### Bug Fixes
- Windows fixes for path separators
- Windows users can ant build the robolectric library and run the robolectric tests
- Colors that reference other colors
- Robolectric will now work on projects that do not use the Google Maps API and other optional packages.

#### Other
- We have added [Roboguice](http://code.google.com/p/roboguice/) integration to the
  [robolectric-samples](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric-samples) project.
- Support for maven and submission to central is WIP


-----
### Release 0.9.2 - November 24, 2010
-----

#### Features
- Shadow classes for SQLite database (Thanks mportuesi!)
- Lint test for shadow methods that match Android methods but are not annotated with @Implementation
- Shadow support for raw resources (Thanks macarse!)
- Improved quick start documentation

#### Bug Fixes
- Ignore non xml files in layouts directory (Subversion .svn directories were causing cryptic errors, Thanks rlgomes!)

-----
### Release 0.9.1 - November 19, 2010
-----

#### Features
- Integrated support for several new Shadow classes from pull requests -- thank you mportuesi!

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed JSON "stub!" exceptions.


-----
### Release 0.9 - November 17, 2010
-----

#### Features
- Integrated support for several new Shadow classes from pull requests - Thank you contributors!
- Made the default RobolectricTestRunner robust enough to work without modification for most projects
- Improved the extensibility of RobolectricTestRunner for those projects that do need to add more functionality
- Encapsulated most of the fields on the Shadow classes
- Added support for the android.net.Uri class so that it works the same way in tests that it does in production. This is
a departure from the behavior of the Shadow classes. We did this because Uri is a utility class, and it would be
almost impossible to write a useful Shadow class for it.
- Improved documentation
- Added run configurations to make it easier to get Robolectric working out of the box

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed support for equals(), hashcode(), and toString()
- Improved the documentation for getting Robolectric to work under Eclipse


-----
### Release 0.8 - November 5, 2010
-----

#### Features
- &lt;include&gt; tags apply their attributes to the imported element
- equals(), hashcode(), and toString() can be overridden on all Shadow classes
- Put a link to the Tracker project in the Robolectric User Guide
- Added support for Eclipse

#### Bug Fixes
- ResourceLoader obtained from context, not stored statically
- Instrumented class cache no longer retains stale entries
