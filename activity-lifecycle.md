# Driving the Activity Lifecycle

Before Robolectric 2.2, most tests created Activities by calling constructors directly, (`new MyActivity()`) and
then manually calling lifecycle methods such as `onCreate()`. Also widely used were a set of methods in
`ShadowActivity` (for instance `ShadowActivity.callOnCreate()`) that are precursors to `ActivityController`.

It was a mess. The `ActivityController` is a Robolectric API that changes all of this. Its goal is to mimic how
Android creates your Activities and drives them through their lifecycle.

`ActivityController` is a fluent API that was introduced in Robolectric 2.0 and is now required in 2.2. In addition
to calling methods like `onCreate()`, it ensures that the internal state of the Activity is consistent with the
lifecycle. This includes attaching the Activity to the Window and making system services like the `LayoutInflater`
available.

# What do I do now?

You don't generally create an `ActivityController` directly. Use `Robolectric.buildActivity()` to get started. For
the most basic of tests where you simply need an initialized Activity, you can often get away with the following line:

```java
Activity activity = Robolectric.buildActivity(MyAwesomeActivity.class).create().get();
```

This will create a new instance of `MyAwesomeActivity` and call through the life cycle to `onCreate()`.

Want to check that something happens during `onResume()` but not `onCreate()`? Easy!

```java
ActivityController controller = Robolectric.buildActivity(MyAwesomeActivity.class).create().start();
Activity activity = controller.get();
// assert that something hasn't happened
activityController.resume();
// assert it happened!
```

Similar methods are included for `start()`, `pause()`, `stop()`, and `destroy()`. So, if you want to test the full
creation lifecycle:

```java
Activity activity = Robolectric.buildActivity(MyAwesomeActivity.class).create().start().resume().visible().get();
```

You can simulate starting the Activity with an intent:

```java
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
Activity activity = Robolectric.buildActivity(MyAwesomeActivity.class, intent).create().get();
```

... or restore saved instance state:

```java
Bundle savedInstanceState = new Bundle();
Activity activity = Robolectric.buildActivity(MyAwesomeActivity.class)
    .create()
    .restoreInstanceState(savedInstanceState)
    .get();
```

Check out the [`ActivityController` Java Docs](/javadoc/latest/org/robolectric/util/ActivityController.html) to see more
public methods available for your testing needs.

# Wait, What's This `visible()` Nonsense?

Turns out that in a real Android app, the view hierarchy of an `Activity` is not attached to the `Window` until
sometime after `onCreate()` is called. Until this happens, the `Activity`'s views do not report as visible. This
means you can't click on them (amongst other unexpected behavior). The `Activity`'s hierarchy is attached to the
`Window` on a device or emulator *after* `onPostResume()` on the `Activity`. Rather than make assumptions about
when the visibility should be updated, Robolectric puts the power in the developer's hands when writing tests.

So when do you call it? Whenever you're interacting with the views inside the `Activity`. Methods like
`Robolectric.clickOn()` require that the view is visible and properly attached in order to function. You should
call `visible()` after `create()`.
