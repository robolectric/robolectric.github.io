### Earlier versions

In earlier versions of AGP Robolectric you must specify the `constants` field which points to the `BuildConfig.class` generated by the build system. Robolectric uses the constants in the class to compute the output paths used by Gradle when building your project. Without these values, Robolectric will not be able to find your merged manifest, resources, or assets. This will cease to work in the future so we strongly recomend migrating to the new API.

```groovy
testCompile "org.robolectric:robolectric:{{ site.robolectric.version.current | escape }}"
```

Annotate your test with the Robolectric test runner and configure Robolectric to find your resources.

```java
@RunWith(RobolectricTestRunner.class)
@Config(constants = BuildConfig.class)
public class SandwichTest {
}
```

## Building with Maven

Add the following to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.robolectric</groupId>
   <artifactId>robolectric</artifactId>
   <version>{{ site.robolectric.version.current | escape }}</version>
   <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Annotate your test with the base test runner:

```java
@RunWith(RobolectricTestRunner.class)
public class SandwichTest {
}
```

If you reference resources that are outside of your project (i.e. in a aar dependency), you will need to provide Robolectric with a pointer to the exploded aar in your build system. See the section titled "Using Library Resources" for more information.

## Building with Android Studio

Robolectric works with Android Studio 1.1.0 or newer. Simply follow the instructions above for working with Gradle. For versions of Android Studio older than 2.0.0, enable the unit test support in the "Build Variants" tab and run your test. As of Android Studio 2.0.0, the test artifacts feature is enabled by default, and the setting to enable/disable test artifacts can be found in File Menu -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Experimental.

### Updating JUnit run configurations

You will probably also need to configure the default JUnit test runner configuration in order to work around a bug where Android Studio does not set the working directory to the module being tested. This can be accomplished by editing the run configurations, `Defaults -> Android JUnit` and changing the working directory value to `$MODULE_DIR$`.

Note that if you already have existing JUnit configurations (`Android JUnit` in the root of the tree), you must do the same change as described above for all of them.

## Building with Eclipse

Install the [m2e-android](http://rgladwell.github.io/m2e-android/) plugin for Eclipse, and import the project as a Maven project. After importing into Eclipse, you have to mark the *consume-aar* goal as ignored, since AAR consumption is not yet supported by m2e-android. To do this, simply apply the Quick fix on the "Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration" error. To run your tests, just right click on the project -> *Run as* -> *JUnit Test*, then choose the *Eclipse JUnit Launcher*.
